== Welcome to XML2JDTO

XML2JDTO is a powerful and efficient Java library for converting XML documents to Java Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and vice versa. Built on top of JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding), it provides a simplified and optimized API for XML-to-Java object mapping with advanced features such as schema validation, catalog-based XSD resolution, and intelligent caching.

=== Why XML2JDTO?

* *Simple API*: Easy-to-use utility methods for marshalling and unmarshalling
* *Performance Optimized*: Built-in caching mechanisms for JAXBContext and Schema instances
* *Schema Validation*: Comprehensive XSD validation support with detailed error reporting
* *Catalog Support*: Advanced XSD catalog resolution for complex schema dependencies
* *Thread-Safe*: Designed for concurrent usage in multi-threaded environments
* *Modern Java*: Built for Java 21+ with contemporary best practices

=== Quick Example

[source,java]
----
import io.github.debug.xml2jdto.core.jaxb.JaxbUtil;

// Unmarshal XML to Java object
String xml = "<person><name>John Doe</name><age>30</age></person>";
Person person = JaxbUtil.unmarshal(xml, Person.class);

// Marshal Java object to XML
String xmlOutput = JaxbUtil.marshal(person);
----

=== Key Features

==== Unmarshalling

Convert XML strings or streams into Java objects with optional schema validation:

* Basic unmarshalling without validation
* Schema-validated unmarshalling
* Support for InputStream sources
* Detailed validation error reporting

==== Marshalling

Convert Java objects into XML strings with customizable formatting:

* Formatted and compact XML output
* Custom marshaller properties
* Schema validation during marshalling
* UTF-8 encoding support

==== Schema Management

Advanced schema handling capabilities:

* Automatic schema caching
* Catalog-based XML schema resolution
* Support for complex schema dependencies
* Configurable schema locations

==== Error Handling

Comprehensive exception hierarchy for precise error handling:

* `Xml2jDtoException` - Base exception for all library operations
* `MalformedXmlException` - Invalid XML structure errors
* `InvalidXmlSchemaException` - Schema validation failures
* `InvalidMethodParameterException` - Parameter validation errors
